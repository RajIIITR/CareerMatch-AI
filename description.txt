Hi all, We're hiring a Machine Learning Engineer at REint.ai! We develop ML, deep learning, and reinforcement learning models to automate power trading in global electricity markets, operating 24/7, 365 days a year. The role involves working with diverse datasets (e.g., gridded weather data, satellite imagery, electricity prices), building models (from traditional ML to advanced DL), and deploying them in production. You’ll join a small, globally distributed team. We’re an early-stage startup, funded by global investors, offering a highly competitive salary and equity package. Interested? Email your latest resume to tarun.raj@reint.ai, mentioning one machine learning project you’re proud of (e.g., Kaggle competitions, GitHub repos, or work projects). Open to folks with and without formal work experience. Please share with anyone who might be a fit!
